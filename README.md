# DCS-BIOS Arduino Library

This is an Arduino library that makes it easy to write sketches that talk to DCS-BIOS.

For now, the included examples are the only documentation.

The included `MasterCaution` example shows a minimal working setup (one button and one LED) and explains the basics of using the library.
The `TacanPanel` example shows how to use more of the pre-defined control classes to handle rotary switches and rotary encoders.
